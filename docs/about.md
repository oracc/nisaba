### About Nisaba

#### What is Oracc?
Oracc is the [Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus](http://oracc.org).
It provides open-access, standards-based publication platforms, research tools
and teaching resources for Assyriology and ancient Near Eastern History,
hosting around 40 academic research projects worldwide.

Oracc has become established as one of the core online resources in the world
of ancient Near Eastern studies. It originated in an AHRC-funded research project
[Prof. Eleanor Robson](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/history/people/academic-staff/eleanor-robson)
ran at the University of Cambridge several years ago and is now continuing to
run from University College London in collaboration with University of
Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).

#### What is Nisaba?

Nisaba is the new text editor that enables Oracc content creators to view, edit and validate documents recording the content of cunneiform tablets from
various ancient Mesopotamian cultures, translated and formatted for the modern reader. These documents are text files in the 
[ASCII Transliteration Format](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/doc/help/editinginatf/index.html)
(ATF), originally developed for the Oracc project. Nisaba is being developed as an extenstion to [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), a text editor developed by Microsoft.

Nisaba's precursor is [Nammu](https://github.com/oracc/nammu) which was developed as a cross-platform stand-alone tool, and has now reached the end of its active development life. It will remain accessible but with very limited maintenance. Nisaba is now the official tool for ATF edition. 

Nisaba has been funded by Oracc and [Nahrein](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/nahrein/), and as such aims to cover the needs of both initiatives, including making ATF edition more user friendly for Arabic- and Farsi-speaking content creators.

Oracc content creators originally used an Emacs plugin for edition,
validation and lemmatisation of ATF files. This plugin can only be installed as
part of [Emacs](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/doc/help/usingemacs/emacssetup/index.html),
which can have a steep learning curve.

With Nisaba, as well as with Nammu in the past, we intend to make a user friendly tool that would replace the use
of the [Oracc Emacs plugin](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/doc/help/nammuandemacs/emacssetup/index.html). This will help lower the access barriers to the use
of Oracc, enabling more projects to adopt it.

Nisaba is currently being developed by the
[UCL Research Software Development Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/about/research-software-development).
