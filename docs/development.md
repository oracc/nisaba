# Installation for developers

## Development workflow

After cloning the repository, enter this directory and install the dependencies
with the command

```
npm install
```

Then you can compile, package, and install the extension with

```
npm run compile
npm run package
code --install-extension nisaba-0.0.1.vsix
```

If you open this directory in Visual Studio Code, you should be able to run the
compile and package commands from the list of "npm scripts" in the sidebar on
the left.  (Re)start Visual Studio Code to make the changes take effect:

```
code
```

## Running tests

After having installed all dependencies with `npm install` and compiled the
package with `npm run compile`, you can run the tests for the package with

```
npm run test
```

## Debugging tips

To debug the syntax highlighting (currently implemented as a [Textmate
grammar](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide))
trigger the [scope
inspector](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide#scope-inspector)
from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) with the `Developer: Inspect Editor
Tokens and Scopes` command.
